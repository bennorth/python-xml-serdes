# XMLserdes: XML Serialisation and Deserialisation

Mechanisms for serializing Python objects to XML, and deserializing them
from XML.  The top-level object in a serialization is almost always an
instance of some class having multiple properties to be de/serialized.
Support is provided for declarative specification of how this is to be
done.

## Supported Python versions

 * Python 2.7
 * Python 3.5
 * Python 3.6
 * Python 3.7

Note that Python 3.4 officialy reached end-of-life in March 2019, so
is no longer supported by this package.
