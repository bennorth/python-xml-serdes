# XMLserdes: XML Serialisation and Deserialisation

Mechanisms for serializing Python objects to XML, and deserializing them
from XML.  The top-level object in a serialization is almost always an
instance of some class having multiple properties to be de/serialized.
Support is provided for declarative specification of how this is to be
done.

## Status

As of 2022, I have no current plans to work on this further.

## Supported Python versions

 * Python 3.8
 * Python 3.9
 * Python 3.10

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://python-xml-serdes.readthedocs.io/en/master/).
