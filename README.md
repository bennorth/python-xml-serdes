# XMLserdes: XML Serialisation and Deserialisation

Mechanisms for serializing Python objects to XML, and deserializing them
from XML.  The top-level object in a serialization is almost always an
instance of some class having multiple properties to be de/serialized.
Support is provided for declarative specification of how this is to be
done.
